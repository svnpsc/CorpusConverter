CorpusConverter
===============

A Java API for work with and convert between the corpus formats CoNLL, TigerXML and FrameNet.

In corpus linguistics different kinds of formats are in use. This JAVA projects tries to serve
an ease way to work with some of them in an intuitive object oriented way and convert from one
format to another.

This project evolved from a hands-on seminar at the chair in Computational Linguistics at the
University of Trier. For detailed information please read the PDF document Ausarbeitung.pdf (in german).

For an API usage example take a look at /src/Sample.java.
